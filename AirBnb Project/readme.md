# 🏘️ AirBnb Market Analysis Dashboard

This repository contains the Tableau workbook for an interactive dashboard that analyzes key metrics within a local short-term rental market ( Airbnb ). This project demonstrates my ability  visualize complex, geographical, and time-series data into a professional and actionable dashboard.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The primary goal of this dashboard is to provide a clear, visual overview of the market's dynamics for hosts, property managers, or real estate investors. The dashboard aims to answer critical business questions, such as:

* What are the **most profitable** or **most expensive** property types and listings?
* How do **pricing structures** vary across different geographical areas (Towns/Neighborhoods)?
* What is the **seasonal trend** in guest engagement (reviews) over time?
* What is the **availability** landscape for properties throughout the year?

## 🔍 Dashboard Components & Key Insights

The dashboard is organized into six distinct visualizations, each providing a specific insight:

1.  **Top 5 Hostnames in terms of price:** Identifies the highest-priced hostnames/neighborhoods, which can indicate luxury or high-demand areas.
2.  **Available Days for every listing over the year:** A scatter map showing property density and availability, useful for finding undersaturated areas.
3.  **Top 10 listings by price:** A detailed bar chart highlighting specific, highly expensive properties in the market.
4.  **Min nights by Room Type:** A simple pie chart (or donut chart) showing the typical minimum stay required, which helps categorize properties (short-term vs. extended stay).
5.  **AVG number of reviews over time:** A line chart showing the market's activity and growth over the past several years.
6.  **Average price by room type:** A critical bar chart comparing the typical cost of a Hotel Room, Entire Home/Apt, Private Room, and Shared Room.
