# üè† Airbnb Listing Analysis Dashboard Project

Welcome to the Airbnb Listing Analysis Dashboard Project! This project utilizes **Tableau Public** to transform raw Airbnb data into insightful, interactive visualizations. Our goal is to provide a clear, comprehensive view of listing performance, host activity, pricing trends, and key metrics.


## ‚ú® Key Features & Dashboards

This project is structured into three main interactive dashboards and a dedicated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) view, each offering a deep dive into different aspects of the Airbnb data:
