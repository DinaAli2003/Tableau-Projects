# 📊 Tableau Data Visualization Projects

This repository is a dedicated showcase of my projects created using **Tableau Desktop** and **Tableau Public**. It serves as a practical demonstration of my proficiency in data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and creating compelling, interactive data visualizations and dashboards.

My goal in sharing these projects is to illustrate my journey and growth in **data analysis** and my commitment to transforming raw data into actionable insights and engaging narratives.

## 🛠️ Skills and Tools Demonstrated

These projects collectively highlight the following technical skills and tools:

| Skill/Tool | Icon | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Data Visualization** | 🎨 | Creating various chart types (bar, line, scatter, maps, etc.) and effective dashboard design principles. |
| **Tableau Desktop** | 🖥️ | Extensive use of the primary visualization tool for connectivity, development, and publishing. |
| **Data Preparation** | 🧼 | Cleaning, structuring, and manipulating data within Tableau (e.g., pivots, joins, calculated fields). |
| **Calculated Fields** | ➕ | Writing complex calculations, **LOD expressions**, and parameters to derive deeper insights. |
| **Interactive Dashboards** | 🖱️ | Implementing filters, actions, and user-friendly navigation for enhanced user experience. |

## 💡 Data Visualization Methodology

For every project, I adhere to a structured, four-stage visualization process to ensure accuracy and maximize impact:

1.  **Understand & Define** 🤔: Clearly defining the business question and identifying the key metrics and data required to answer it.
2.  **Prepare & Clean** 🧹: Ensuring data quality, handling missing values, standardizing formats, and performing necessary transformations (often using **Tableau Prep** or **SQL**).
3.  **Explore & Iterate** 🔍: Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Tableau to uncover patterns and relationships, then iterating on chart types to find the most effective visual representation.
4.  **Design & Publish** ✨: Applying best practices in dashboard design, ensuring accessibility, optimizing performance, and crafting a clear narrative before publishing the final product.

## ⚙️ Requirements & How to View

To open and explore the `.twbx` files locally:

* **Software**: You must have **Tableau Desktop** (version 2021.4 or newer is recommended) or the free **Tableau Reader** installed.
* **Data Source**: All packaged workbooks (`.twbx`) include the data source internally, making them ready to open immediately.
* **Quick View**: For the fastest experience, click the **Tableau Public Link** for the respective project to view the interactive version directly in your web browser.

## 🚀 My Data Analysis Journey

While this repository focuses on **Tableau**, my data analysis journey involves a diverse toolkit to ensure I can handle any data challenge. I am continuously learning and integrating the following tools into my workflow:

* **Python** 🐍: For advanced data cleaning, statistical analysis (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, seaborn), and machine learning.
* **SQL** 🗄️: For robust data querying, manipulation, and database management.
* **Power BI** ⚡: Exploring alternative visualization platforms to broaden my dashboarding capabilities.
* **Excel/Google Sheets** 📄: For foundational data management and initial processing.
