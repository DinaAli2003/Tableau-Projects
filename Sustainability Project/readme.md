# 🌳 Global Sustainability Performance & Impact Analyzer

## 1. Project Title: **Global Sustainability Performance & Impact Analyzer** 🌍

***

## 2. Overview 💡

This project features a comprehensive **Sustainability Performance Dashboard** built using **Tableau**. It is designed to track, analyze, and optimize the organization's environmental footprint, product ratings, and efficiency metrics across the supply chain. The solution is crucial for ESG reporting, operational teams, and management seeking immediate, data-driven insights to meet strategic sustainability targets, enhance brand reputation, and manage resource efficiency.

***

## 3. Key Objectives 🎯

The dashboard suite is structured to address the following critical business dimensions, supported by the five Tableau Dashbaords :

* **Environmental Footprint:** 💨 Monitor core resource outputs like **Total $\text{CO}_2\text{e}$, Total Water Consumed,** and **Waste Diversion Rate** across all operational scopes.
* **Operational & Cost Efficiency:** ⚙️ Analyze **Cost of Carbon Abatement** and **Water Usage per Unit** to manage resource efficiency and financial health simultaneously.
* **Product & Brand Ratings:** ⭐ Track the **Average Sustainability Rating** and **Material Renewability Mix** to inform R&D, inventory, and consumer communication strategies.
* **Geographic & Trend Analysis:** 🗺️ Visualize **Emissions by Region/Facility** and track **Year-over-Year $\text{CO}_2\text{e}$** to focus abatement efforts geographically and temporally.
* **Financial & Investment Impact:** 💰 Connect **Revenue by Sustainable Product** line with the **Return on Green Investments (ROI)** to validate strategic sustainability spending.

## 4. Dashboard Breakdown & Key Insights 📊

The solution comprises five functional screens: **Executive KPIs (Dashboard1), Environmental Core (Dashboard2,Dashboard3),** and **Operational & Financial (Dashboard4,Dashboard5)**.

### **Executive KPIs: The Summary (Dashboard1) 📈**

This screen pulls high-level, aggregate metrics from the entire report for quick executive status checks.

| Icon | Key Metric | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **☁️** | **Total $\text{CO}_2\text{e}$ Emissions** | The total realized Greenhouse Gas Emissions across all scopes (e.g., $50\text{K}$ tons). |
| **🌊** | **Total Water Consumed** | The total volume of water used across operations (e.g., $10\text{M}$ Liters). |
| **♻️** | **Recycling Rate** | The percentage of waste diverted from landfills (e.g., $65\%$). |
| **💵** | **Total Revenue** | The total revenue monitored in the system, serving as a normalization factor. |
| **🏅** | **Avg. Sustainability Rating** | The overall average sustainability score across the product portfolio. |
| **🗺️** | **Top Impact Region** | Identifying the region or facility with the highest environmental impact. |

## 5. Interactivity and Usage 🖱️

This dashboard is highly interactive, leveraging **Tableau's Action Filters** and **Parameters** for granular, dynamic analysis.

* **Filters (Parameter Control):** 🔍 Use filters like **Region, Product Category,** and **Year** to dynamically focus all visuals on a specific operational segment or time period.
* **Action Filters (Deep Dive):** 🔗 Clicking on any element (e.g., a specific "Region" on the map or an "Emissions Scope" in the bar chart) will instantly filter every other visual across the report to show the associated metrics and trends.

### **How to Use:** ▶️

1.  Open the Tableau Workbook (`Sustainability Project.twbx` file) in **Tableau Desktop** .
2.  Navigate sequentially between the report sheets (`Dashboard1` through `Dashboard5`) for a comprehensive review.
3.  Use the **Filters and Parameters** to select specific dimensions for focused analysis.
4.  Interact directly with the charts to analyze trends and gain strategic insights into operational and brand sustainability performance.
